* [http://patilnabhi.github.io/tbotnav]

***This is a [ROS] project developed during the winter quarter at Northwestern University ([NU]) as part of M.S. in Robotics (MSR) program.
(ROS stands for Robot Operating System).***

####Goal:#### 

* To navigate turtlebot using hand-gestures to find target locations marked with AR codes and/or to find a specific person using face-recognition

####Objectives:####

1. One
2. Two
3. Three
4. Four

####Overview:####

* The overall execution of the project is summarised in the flow-chart below:

* *Flow-chart*

* *Video*

####Details:####  

1. **Turtlebot SLAM using RTAB-Map**:  

    * Start in /odom frame
    * map --> odom transform with PoseScanMatching helps to correct odometry
    * *(Future Work) Once all the target locations have been explored, switch to /map frame (with localization = true)*  
    * Parameters involved:  
        * One
        * Two

2. **Hand-gesture recognition**:  
    * Start in /odom frame
    * map --> odom transform with PoseScanMatching helps to correct odometry
    * *(Future Work) Once all the target locations have been explored, switch to /map frame (with localization = true)*  
    * Parameters involved:

The **goal** of this project was to use [baxter] robot to pick and place objects from one location to another.

The following video shows our project in action:

**Summary**:

* Baxter robot is used to pick and place different sized square blocks from one location to another
* Our group not only got baxter to pick & place the square blocks, but also stack larger of the cubes on top of each other
* The project consists of 3 major elements:
    * **Image processing**: [OpenCv] is used as a tool to detect objects & process images from baxter's camera. A transformation of the objects in the image frame is obtained.
    * **Moving baxter's arms**: [MoveIt!] is used as a tool to move baxter's arms to pick and place objects. 
    * **Planning scene**: MoveIt! is also used to visualize the planning scene in [Rviz] - a 3D visualization tool for ROS. Planning scene consisted of objects present around baxter. The main purpose was not only to visualize the scene, but also to prevent baxter from colliding with these objects

**Future work**:
    
* Improved camera calibration
* GUI development: A Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows user to click an object in the virtual world (e.g in [Gazebo]), and pick and place that particular object.
