***This is part of a [ROS] project developed during the winter quarter at Northwestern University ([NU]) as part of M.S. in Robotics (MSR) program.
(ROS stands for Robot Operating System).***

####Project Website:
* [http://patilnabhi.github.io/tbotnav] 

####Goal:

* Using a webcam, OpenCV and ROS, develop an API to recognize people in real-time

####Tasks:

* This project can be broken down into 6 main tasks:

1. **Detect faces:**   
<br>
2. **Capture faces:**    
<br>
3. **Train face data using Fisher's Linear Discriminant Algorithm (LDA):**  
<br>
4. **Recognize faces:**  
<br>
5. **Create a simple GUI to capture and recognize faces:**  
<br>
6. **Integrate with ROS:** 

####Future work:
    
* Improve accuracy of classification by combining various classifiers such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and LDA; this could be done using a Radial Basis Function (RBF)-based interpolation
