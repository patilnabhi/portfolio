**Project Objectives**:

* Build a servo controlled pan-tilt camera system
* Program the camera to track target objects

**Project Details**:

* A servo controller was assembled to mount a webcam
* A `ROS` node was developed to control the pan-tilt servo mechanism
* Image processing using `OpenCV` script was written to filter out the target object (a red ball was chosen)
* Using data from above processing, a `ROS` node was developed to get the location of the red ball

**Project Demo**:
