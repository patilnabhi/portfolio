This was a final project for Theory of Machine Dynamics course at Northwestern University (NU). The **goal** of this project was to simulate and animate the behavior of a spinning top using [Mathematica] software. 

**Project Objectives**:

* Develop a mathematical model to simulate behavior of spinning top using **[lagrangian mechanics]**
* Deduce the precession and nutation behavior of the top, in turn answering the classic question - *'What keeps spinning tops upright?'*
* Generate a 3D graphics model in Mathematica
* Use Mathematica to animate the 3D model to illustrate various behaviors of spinning top

**Drawing of system**:

To keep the project feasible, following **assumptions** were made:

* Top modelled as a 'heavy' top that remains fixed to hte round
* Geometry of top simplified; it is modelled as a wheel on a thin stem as shown in above figure

**Results**:

3 types of simulations are produced to study top's precession & nutation behavior:

1. Initial recession rate is **equal** to zero:

	Video coming soon!

2. Initial precession rate is **greater** than zero

	Video coming soon!

3. Initial precession rate is **less** than zero

	Video coming soon!
