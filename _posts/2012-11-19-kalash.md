**Project Details:**

* A mechanical design assignment as part of Design For Manufacturing & Assembly module at National University of Singapore (NUS)

**Objectives**:

* Design a 3D model of 'complex' object
* Determine the key features of the selected object that need to be met after fabrication
* Determine the appropriate Rapid Prototype (RP) process - (an additive manufacturing process)
* Determine the parameters of the chosen RP process that need to be tuned for best fabrication results

**Chosen Object: 'Kalash'**:

* ‘Kalash’ is used as a decorative motif in Indian art
* It is usually made of metals like bronze, copper, silver and gold. It comes in various designs, sizes, patterns and finishes
* Fabrication of 'Kalash' using RP process needs to adhere to the following properties -
	* The RP prototype will be further used as pattern for investment casting.
	* The prototype has a smooth surface finish.
	* The size of the prototype is such that it fits in a 20 cm by 20 cm cuboid.

* Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) was chosen based on following factors:
	* Speed of process
	* Accuracy
	* Support structures
	* Cost

* For SLS, four parameters affect the quality of part:
	* Part orientation
	* Powder properties
	* Laser beam
	* Machine operation
* In this assignment, focus was on **optimal part orientation**. Following part orientation was determined to be optimal as it achieves minimum build height and hence, minimum build time, and minimum surface roughness:
