**Project Details:**

* **Topic**: Investigation and Development of a Novel Continuous Blood Pressure (BP)Monitoring System Based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
* A final year thesis project in partial fulfilment of requirements for B.E. Mechanical at National University of Singapore (NUS) 
* The project involved use of knowledge from medical, computer and programming disciplines

**Motivation for Project:**

* Healthcare has become an important issue in aging countries such as Singapore
* There is a need to have such solutions where people can monitor their health themselves
* Continuous vital signs monitoring devices are needed that are economical, portable, simple and reliable
* Among these vital signs, continuous monitoring of BP is very important, especially for
elderly people with chronic cardiac conditions

**Objectives of Project:**

The main objectives of this project are:

* To develop a Peaks Detection Algorithm (PDA) for Pulse Transit TIme (PTT) calculation. 
* To develop an ANN model to obtain beat-to-beat BP values. This involves training and testing the ANN, debugging the model and incorporating the model into a vital signs monitoring device
* In addition, an ECGnPPG Unit (EPU) was also developed to determine the Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals for calculating the PTT

**Tasks:**

The above-mentioned objectives were achieved via the following tasks:

* An integrated code consisting of following was generated:
	* User Prompt,
	* Peaks Detection Algorithm,
	* PTT Calculation, and
	* ANN Model
* An ECGnPPG Unit (EPU) was developed to determine the Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals for calculating the PTT
* A preliminary study was conducted on 10 subjects to validate the objectives
