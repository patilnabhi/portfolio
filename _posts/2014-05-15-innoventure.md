**Project Details:**

* [Innoventure] was a technopreneurship competition at National University of Singapore (NUS)
* Our group (consisting of 3 members) secured [top position] out of 6 participating teams
* Keen interest was shown by a few companies to take this project to commercialisation stage
* The challenge was to understand the actual problems faced, propose a solution and a business plan, and develop a prototype for a real-life problem by Jurong Town Corporation (JTC)

**Problem Statement**: Increase the efficiency of sand discharge from Bulk Carriers *(Given to us by JTC)*

**Our Solution**: Unique mobile Hopper-Conveyor system that reduces the total time of discharge by half *(Note: On the innoventure website, the name of our solution is given as 'MaxMobile')*

* We developed a *working* prototype to validate our proposed solution; a video of our prototype (hopper-conveyor system) in action is reproduced below
* The following poster summarises our view of the problem, our proposed solution and the business plan we put forth
